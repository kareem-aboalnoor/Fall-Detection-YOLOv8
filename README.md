**🎥 Real-time Fall Detection from Video Using YOLOv8m and OpenCV**

This project implements a high-performance **fall detection system** capable of detecting human falls in real-time video streams. It uses the **YOLOv8m** model trained on a custom dataset from **Roboflow**, achieving excellent accuracy.  
✅ Red bounding boxes for fall events with confidence scores  
✅ Green bounding boxes for normal persons

## 📚 Dataset

The dataset for training was collected and annotated via **Roboflow**.  
It contains images of humans performing falls and normal activities.
